# Banking Application Automation Testing Project
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Banking Application Automation Testing Project. The project aims to automate the testing of a banking application to ensure its functionality is error-free and reliable.

# Features
Automated Testing Framework: I have developed a robust automated testing framework using the following technologies:

* Selenium WebDriver: For browser automation.
* Java: As the programming language for test script development.
* TestNG: For test case management and reporting.
* Maven: To manage project dependencies and build automation.
* Page Object Model (POM): For efficient organization and maintenance of test scripts.
* Test Scenario Implementation: I have implemented a range of test scenarios that rigorously test the banking application's functionality. These scenarios cover various aspects of the application, ensuring     
  comprehensive test coverage.
